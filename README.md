## Gamesense Lovense Lua
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-lua-blue)

A Lua for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat Gamesense which controls a Lovense sextoy through Lan API requests

Currently the lua supports Lovense toys only, with more toy support planned to come. Currently all requests are done through the LAN API of Lovense with the downside being bluetooth. The lua also supports a partner system which allows you to set other players as partners, thus letting them trigger your sextoy.
